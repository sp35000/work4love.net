  Canberra is a planned city built to be the Australia's capital. It is located
  in ACT - Australian Capital Territory.

  I went to Canberra in a excursion organised by my school and visited many
  interest places:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      Botanic Garden, a place full of Australian and non-Australian flora.
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      Flor&iacute;ade, that is a traditional flowers exposition.
  </UL>

  <UL>
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      National War Memoriam Museum where all the wars Australian took part are
      showed like the two World Wars and some conflicts in South Africa, Korea
      and Vietnam.
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      Mount Ainslie, from where the New and the Old Parliament can be seen.
  </UL>
  <P ALIGN=Center>
  <IMG SRC="canberra.jpg" WIDTH="499" HEIGHT="330" ALT="Canberra: Old and New Parliament view from Mount Ainslie."
      BORDER="0"><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      Australian National Gallery, where there are many paintings of Aboriginal
      and non-Aboriginal art, including paintings telling the story of Ned Kelly,
      a famous bushranger (an outlaw who runaway to the bush) considered a hero
      in Australia.
    <LI>
      <P ALIGN=Left>
      New Parliament composed by the House of the Representatives, where the population
      divided in 148 districts is represented, and the Senate, where States and
      Territories are also represented. An interesting fact is that because Australian
      has relatively few inhabitants (18 millions), the number of politicians is
      small too.

  In my opinion, however sometimes Canberra seems more friendly to cars than
  to men, it is a very clean, well planed and with a large number of trees.
  All these points make Canberra a good place to live.
