  Melbourne Cup
</H1>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Australians usually appreciate sports and one of the most preferred is horse
race. Melbourne Cup is a traditional horse race seen by people all over the
Australia and it stops all the country for about 3 minutes. In Melbourne
the day is a holiday.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Every year, on the first Tuesday of November, almost everybody in the country
bets in some horses. I visited Melbourne at that time and had the opportunity
to go and see the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Race Course. The party puts
sport and fashion together and it was really great.

Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia and it has a different
style when compared to Sydney. Melbourne has an European style, closer to
England; it has&nbsp;a large number of Italian and Greek community. Sydney
seems closer to Asian and South Pacific countries, with many Asian and Aboriginal
people in the streets. Anyway, both of them are really nice cities, great
places to live.

Some places I visited in Melbourne were:

In my opinion, there was something in Melbourne that reminded my city, Sao
Paulo, when I was walking in Elizabeth St. Perhaps the style of the buildings
or the way people dress themselves. However, there are much more people walking
on the streets in Sao Paulo, which is a really crowded and busy city and
Melbourne is more relaxed. It is also better than Sao Paulo in many aspects
like pollution, violence or public transport, which is really peculiar due
to use of the trams.
