	Youth Hostel Australia - Sydney Central - This is the best youth hostel I
	have already seen and I can recommend it. It is a building with 9 floors,
	electronic access to the bedrooms, sauna, swimming pool, an excellent restaurant
	with breakfast, lunch and dinner, a big living room, Internet access and
	Scubar, the hostel's pub. It is not expensive, nice people working there
	and it is located near the Central Station, so it is close to many places.
	You can book by e-mail:
