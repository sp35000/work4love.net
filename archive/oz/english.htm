I represented Rotary Club of Interlagos
- Sao Paulo - SP - Brazil in Wagga Wagga - NSW - Australia as a Cultural
Ambassador doing a 3-month English Course.
<CENTER>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  It is a long journey from Sao Paulo to Wagga Wagga and the cities in the
  way are:
  <P ALIGN=Center>
  <STRONG>Sao Paulo - Buenos Aires - Rio Gallegos - Auckland - Sydney - Wagga
  Wagga.</STRONG>
  <P ALIGN=Center>
  <IMG SRC="nz.jpg" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="317" ALT="Auckland, New Zealand" BORDER="0">
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  The total time of the flight was more than 20 hours. The departure in Sao
  Paulo was on September, 3rd afternoon and the arrival in Wagga Wagga was
  on 5th afternoon. Australia and Brazil have 13 hours of difference in time.

  Wagga Wagga is a small city in the New South Wales State with 50,000 inhabitants.
  It is located in the middle of the way to the 3 main Australian cities: Sydney
  (6 hours by train or bus), Canberra (3 hours) and Melbourne (6 hours). Its
  main river is the Murrumbidgee River.
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  Despite the fact that is a small city, there are many international students
  at Charles Sturt University, considered one of the best Australian universities.
  The city is very clean and organised. Not far from city there are some big
  houses in a landscape full of fields, cattle and sheep.
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  ELS Language Centres - Wagga Wagga is part of the Charles Sturt University,
  and attends students from several countries. I met people from Japan, South
  Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, France, Turkey and Denmark.
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  The course at ELS focuses on learning English through Australian studies.
  The points studied include Aboriginal culture, Australian fauna and flora,
  geographic and historic aspects, Australian identity and tourism in Australia.
  In addition, there were some elective classes like conversation and
  pronunciation.
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  The influence of the Australia Homestay program in learning English is very important
  because there are opportunities to practice the language skills in a real
  situation. Travelling is also an excellent option.
