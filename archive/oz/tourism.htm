Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to visit these places due to
the short time I had available in Australia. This text was generated as a
result of my independent research project for ELS Language Centres to complement
my experience as a Rotarian Cultural Ambassador.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The information on this page was researched in tourist information places,
newspaper articles, backpackers' magazines, tourist brochures and folders,
travel agencies, web sites and people who have travelled to the places listed
here.
<P ALIGN=Left>
I am sure that there are many places not typically for tourists and even
some Australians have not already gone to it, so wherever you are from, enjoy
yourself!

  <A NAME="uluru"><!-- --></A>Uluru and Central Australia
</H2>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Central Australia is part of Northern Territory with fantastic landscapes
like Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas). Alice Springs is usually
the starting point to many tourist places. It is also the headquarters of
the Royal Flying Doctor Service that operates a medical service to isolated
towns.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Uluru is about 450 km away from Alice Springs. It is a big red monolith in
the desert, 3.6 km long and 348 m high. It is considered a sacred place to
Aboriginal people and appears in many of their stories. Kata Tjuta is just
about 32 km west and it is a set of impressive monoliths.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Uluru is composed by arkose that is gray inside the caves and red outside
due to oxidation. Arkose is formed by iron oxides, clays and fragments of
other rocks.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The origin of these landscapes remounts from 900 million years ago. First,
sediments begin to be deposited under the sea that existed then until about
400 million years ago. Then the sea receded and a folding and faulting event
raised the region about sea level, originating the formations called Uluru
and Kata Tjuta today. Since then, the erosion process started until nowadays.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Other interest tourist points of Central Australia are Mereenie Loop Road,
King's Canyon and the West MacDonnells. Manifestations of Aboriginal Culture
are also strong in Central Australia.

<P ALIGN=Left>
There are some useful precautions to observe when travelling Northern Territory:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Fauna: jellyfishes can be lethal. They usually appear frequently between
    October and May. Observe the crocodile warning signs too.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Climate: during the Wet Season there are big rains late and overnight,
    spectacular lightning, floods and cyclones in some areas. It is important
    to protect always the skin because of the sun during all the year.

    glasses a water a day or more if people join in activities like walking or
    climbing.

<P ALIGN=Left>
Gantheaume Point is the place to inspect cement casts of dinosaur&#146;s
footsteps, believed to be over 130 million years old.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Some articles in the research showed people who live in the Great Sandy Desert
and Gibson Desert, which are some of the most isolated areas in Australia.
These people however love these places and call them the real Australian
outback. Port Hedland is in the South crossing the Great Sandy Desert. Newman,
that is about 400 km away from Port Hedland, has one of the world&#146;s
largest iron ore mines. There are many mining cities in this area. Coral

<P ALIGN=Left>
South Australia combines the experience of a cultural city, Adelaide and
a wildlife experience in the Outback.

Australia's lifeline, providing commercial transport and opportunities to
meet wildlife, historical towns and vineyards.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Eyre Peninsula occupies an area bigger than Tasmania and includes the Nullarbor
Regional Reserve where the world's largest cave system is located. Another
attraction is the whale watching during their annual breeding migration between
June and October.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The South Australian Outback is one of the most impressive Australian sceneries,
being alone in the desert during the day and seeing stars at night. To travel
in the Outback it is necessary to have good preparation, equipment and a
Desert Parks Pass for camping. The Outback has about 8 million hectares and
is located inside many conservation parks or reserves like Simpson Desert
or Lake Eyre, which is a large salt lake below the sea level. Another attraction
near the Outback is walking trails in the Flinders Ranges and Heysen Trail.
<P ALIGN=Left>
An interesting place to visit is Coober Pedy, in the middle of the South

Some precautions travelling in the Outback include: notify a friend before
departure, protect water supplies, do not pollute the places with soap or
detergent, stay near the main road and respect Aboriginal culture and private
properties.

  <A NAME="tasmania"><!-- --></A>Tasmania
</H2>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Tasmania is located about 240 km off the coast of Victoria and has about
the same size as Ireland. Relatively isolated from the rest of Australia,
its inhabitants call the other states as "main land" and surprisingly, there
are Australians who think Tasmania is another country. This isolation has
protected Tasmania from pests and disease and has preserved flora and fauna,
like the Tasmanian Devil.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Besides the regular flights, the "Spirit of Tasmania" is a famous ship that
connects Victoria to Devonport in North-West Tasmania. This area includes
Cradle Mountain / Lake St. Clair National Park has about 1.4 million hectares
World Heritage area including many tracks to explore. There are also many
agricultural enterprises.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The Far North-West is located beyond the farmlands and has beaches, rain
forests and rivers. King Island is also part of the Far North-West and is
considered a retreat due to its isolation. Strangely, this isolated place
is situated just a short flight from Victoria. King Island offers also a
fabulous diving scenery.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Launceston is the second largest Tasmanian city and it is the place from
where people usually visit north and eastern coast. It is also a historical
city and only about 30 minutes from the centre there are many native animals
in their habitat.
<P ALIGN=Left>
North-Eastern Tasmania&#146;s landscape varies according to the season. Mount
William National Park presents the habitat of several native species. Flinders
Islands is a natural paradise of cruising and diving places, beaches, dunes
and wildlife full of dolphins, wombats, wallabies, possum and many kinds
of birds.
<P ALIGN=Left>
From Launceston to Hobart, Tasmania&#146;s capital, a tourist will follow
the Heritage Highway, a route of settlements reminding all of the colonial
past of Tasmania.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Finally, Hobart is the second oldest Australian city. Although Hobart has
a cosmopolitan life, there are many historical places to visit, as well as
museums and parks. The historical village of Richmond seems as a place for
convicts even nowadays. Hobart has also many festivals through the seasons.
<P ALIGN=Left>
In the South of Tasmania there are the ruins of Port Arthur, a former settlement
for convicts. From Orford, it is possible to go by ferry to Maria Island
where there was a convict settlement older than Port Arthur.

Greater Daintree, the largest remaining Australian rainforest and the Great
Barrier Reef.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The Great Barrier Reef is about 2,300 km long and has a wonderful scenery
of sea life and coral reef, for instance caves, sharks, different fishes,
etc. There is also commercial pearling in Airlington Reef.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Scuba diving is a popular activity practised in this area. It is learned
by many people in Australia due to the low costs of the courses. Before people
do the courses, it is necessary to obtain a doctor's certificate. When
practising, a good trick is use a sunscreen to avoid burning the back and
the legs.
