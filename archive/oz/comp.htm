  Brazil and Australia
</H1>
<P ALIGN=Left>
In my opinion, the nicest characteristic of Australians is that they are
friendly people. They usually enjoy their lives, families, friends, sports
and beaches. In this aspect, they are very similar to Brazilians, but perhaps
due to the British influence they are a little bit more reserved than Brazilians.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Despite Australian passion for sports, their games do not have anything in
common with Brazilian games. Australians like Australian Rules Football,
Rugby and horse races while Brazilians love football and like volleyball
and basketball. I went to the Melbourne Cup, the most famous Australian horse
race, and watched on TV the National Rugby League.

Both countries have a big coast with beautiful beaches, so both people have
a beach culture and passion for the sea. Big land are a common point too,
but Brazil has about nine times Australia's population.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The pub culture is another characteristic of Australia, that is when people
go out with friends to drink and exchange ideas. Brazil has the same kind
of activities. However, because of the variety of Brazilian Music, there
are many more options besides pubs, for example 'casas de samba', 'lambaterias',
'forro' ' and places with 'MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira)'.
<P ALIGN=Left>
In the economical and political aspects Australia has many advantages when
compared to Brazil because many problems related to the economy, health and
education were solved in Australia, yet Brazil has a lack of basic things
in these important aspects.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Many problems in both countries have the same causes, for example, their
big size, bushfires, long distance between the cities, etc. Brazil is a country
that was luckier than Australia when talking about natural resources, water
and soil mainly.
<P ALIGN=Left>
In conclusion, we can say there are more similarities between Brazil and
Australia than differences and unfortunately, there is not a strong relationship
because they are separated by a big distance. However, it is important to
emphasise there are big differences in the economy and this fact has a great
impact on the people and their behaviour when we have a situation that involves
money.
